# Choosing Your First Frontend Framework

## Are you ready for a framework?

You may not be ready to choose a framework for web development. Currently, web development is the wild west.
Frameworks, libraries and tools all vye to be the fastest fun (or at least, the one with the best developer expierience). Without a solid foundation of javscript, html and css you will not be flexible enough to be able to easily switch between these frameworks. It is almost a given that whatever framework you choose now will eventually become obsolete, and if you are unable to switch it up and learn new tools you will be stuck forever working on an obsolete technology. 


The key to knowing when to swich is by carefully gauging the nature and the power of the frusteration which you will inevitably feel when developing in vanilla javascript.
 Developing functional websites and web applications with only vanilla tools is often tedius, and as projects become larger, managing them is very complex. 
 Like most things that are both complicated and tedius, it is also incredibly frusterating at times. Hold on to this frusteration, it will be one of your most important tools to becoming into a strong developer. 
 Try and categorize your annoyances, to compartmentalize your vexation. The important part of this isn't *just* to be self flagelating, sitting at the most notorious programming bars and saying you made everything from scratch. It is to start recognize patterns. You'll notice that very often the reason things piss you off so much is it's *the same exact freaking thing* over and over. 

note for george: these should be more compelling

**Where the hell is this change coming from?! I know I wrote it but I can't remember WHERE?**

**Great, another silent error. I'm so glad that javascript is so well designed and everything fails silently and I have to go through my entire codebase to find it**

**hmm, the more I think about it the more I realize putting everything in this one single file may have not been a great idea**

You may not realize it but you are building *fluency* in javascript and programming in general. When someone mentions unresolved promises you will feel a real and visceral feeling deep in your chest that was never there before. It's a feeling that can't be learned from textbooks alone.\
This fluency is more than just having a good handle on the language, it includes all of the other hidden skills it takes to excel as a programmer. These are the things that are nessicary to understand and choose a framework. Things like being able being able to recognize annoying patterns in your code, and frame them into actionable plans. To be able following a nasty bug from the very begginging until your finally squash it.  To be able to quickly and effeciently copy and paste a function from stack overflow.


Here is a small list of vanilla tutorials to get you started:

## I'm ready, tell me which is the best

Once you feel sufficiently ready to choose a framework, you find yourself in an almost completely new world. This is not the world of cold, hard boolean logic. It is the world of **opiniated programming**. We could go back to the bar fromearlier, and ask the the many programmers there the same question. What framework would it be best to learn first? They would all answer something completely different, and even the ones that agree would probably give you completely different threead of reasoning as to why. One of them would invariably tell you (rather snarkily) that frameworks are a big waste of time and you can should just stick with vanilla javascript. This isn't the big problem, the big problem is that **They are all correct** .   

In programming in general, and web development specifically there are usually an almost infinite anmount of different tools,methods and plans you can use to attack a problem. If you ask someone with more expierience which is the best she will almost answer the same: **It Depends**. 

The reason for this is because **It Depends** is the only answer. **It Depends** is the  *correct* answer. Even better, it is the *technically correct* answer. To you, as a beginner, it's an entirely useless answer.

The reasoning behind **It Depends** is as follows. The problems that you ran into during your vanilla javascript days are not unique. These problems or similiar ones are the seeds that eventually grow into frameworks and other programming libraries  when some very clever people  try their best to solve those problems. They are not however, a universal truth and certainly not built to be some answer to an entirely logical question. Think of our question from before:

**Where the hell is this change coming from?! I know I wrote it but i can't remember WHERE? Have you forsaken me god? should i just become a farmer?**

now lets standaridize into one that may be easier to turn into something actually useful:

**Is there a way to manage changes in my application so that I can better unnderstand where they come from, and more easily debug them?**

Notice that while this question has a logical base, it is still rather open ended and leans much more towards organizing the program to compensate for our human foible rather than some rigourous test of logic that can be solved with our big big programming brains. The opinion is baked in, because there is no way to answer a question like that. There aren't any correct answers, just incorrect ones. It's like asking what the meaning of life is. It's not just logical, it'smuch much worse. It's philsophical. A good programmer knows all this and that's why she will hit you with that stone cold **it depends**. 
The answer really does depend, on strictly logical things like : 

how much space will it take up in the project?

is the solution buggy?

is the solution fast?

but more often than that it is:

Will it be easy for everyone on the team to learn

will I enjoy using it everyday?

Am I the kind of person who would rather just do it myself?


A Programmer answering with **it depends** is sort of like a robot malfunctioning when you ask it if it loves you or if it has feelings. Programmers are creatures of hard, cold logic trying to answer a question that quite simply doesn't have one simple, logical answer.  

back to our question from before:

What *is* the meaning of life?

Try and make your answer logical,precise,succinct and with no room for any mistake or oversight and you might see the answer. 


## Just Use React

If you're still wondering how to pick a framework, the answer really is it doesn't particularly matter which framework you choose to work with. You're not locked in in if you hate it, and you simply don't have enough information to choose at this point in you're career. Definitely choose something popular though, because of the community. 
The easiest way to understand how good a community is is to understand how niche of a question will have to be before it results in an unanswered stack overflow question. A bad community will have no results for something like "How do I append an item to a list?" while a good one will have answers for things like "My birthday was on a leap year which was also the crescent moon, what is the best way to calculate the amount of years until the next crescent moon of a leap year that also falls on a saturday?". 
If you want the best community, choose react. It's simply the biggest and most active framework right now, and to a beginner that almost* makes all other things irrelevant. When you have questions it will be reltaviley easy to find solutions, and there are a plethora of resources and tutorials to learn from when you are starting out. That React happens to be a very good framework with a relatively* easy learning curve and pretty good debugging tools is besides the point. Do at least one project with react before you fully decide to hate it, but once you do you'll find you have similiar questions to your old javascript days in the beginning of this article. 

**Why it so hard to update this one simple value without getting an infinite loop?**

**okay so i guess i like immutable data, but does eveything *have* to be immutable?**`

**It's so smart and scalable to lift state through ten different componets, I'm so glad for one way data flow. Programming should be annoying and hard all the time.**

and so forth.

 Once you get to fed up, you might be ready for the next framework, or you might just need to go back to the docs.Regardless, it's almost always worth trying something new to try out a different mode of thinking. Not just because of hype or the general extensional dread of becoming obsoltete, but because you simply might like it *a lot* better than what your currently using. Or you might realize just how much React meant to you all this time. The new framework might be like a breath of fresh air, solving every problem into you realize that FRICKEN svelt doesn't let you **INSERT GOOD EXAMPLE HERE**.



*note that saying relatively,most of the time, and almost always is basically the only way to say anything in computer science and be **technically correct**.  Always remember the one, only true answer to all your qeustions... 

## Closing

 This article  is not meant to be discouraging, but becoming a competant web devloper truly is a long road. There aren't any shortcuts that won't end up shooting yourself in the foot in the long run. Just stop overthinking, at least in the beginning. Desicison paralysis is a real thing for developers at all levels, not just beginners. And while it is always worthwhile to be thoughtful and directed in your choices, you will always come to a point where it's basically a coin flip. IF you can't flip the coin, you'll choose anything and you'll be stuck forever.
